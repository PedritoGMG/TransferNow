# TransferNow

**TransferNow** is a small Spring Boot project that recreates a basic FTP-like system. It allows users to efficiently upload, manage, and share files while avoiding unnecessary duplicates. It also supports receiving files from other users in real time through public links.

## Features

- Upload files directly or use local paths to avoid duplicates.  
- Receive files from external users via a **public link**; both host and sender must be connected at the same time. Files are **not stored** until approved by the host.  
- Share files temporarily â€” accessible only while the application is running.  
- Organize and manage files easily.
